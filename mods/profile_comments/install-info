By phpbb I mean the core phpbb directory.

Extract the comments folder in the phpbb directory.
Open in the url phpbb/comments/install.php and type the key that will be used to uninstall the mod (password).
After that the script will modify the current template and add a link to the profile page.
Now go to the Admin Panel and clear the cache.
Thats all, if you want to delete the script open phpbb/comments/uninstall.php and enter the key which you used while installing the mod.

Don't forget to delete the install.php file!
